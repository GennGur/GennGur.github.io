OHMYFOOD is the third project of the Openclassrooms web development training.

For this project we have to make the first version of the site with only HTML5 and CSS3 (SCSS).
So we have to make animations with CSS3 as well as some Organization in the code.

In this repository there is my proposal for this project.
